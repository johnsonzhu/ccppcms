**CppCMS is not perfect in the daily development.
  1. CppCMS just apply the MVC Framework's tools, but it didn't offer us a common web framework by splitting in different layout(like Control/Module or Service/Dao and Dal).
  1. CppCMS do not offer a complete Router Map Configuration ,instead of that it need the developers them-self write the map and dispatch in the applications).**

**CppDB is not perfect for the web storage now.
  1. CppDB just apply the api for RDB(MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite3).
  1. CppDB do not have the api for the Nosql(MongoDB, Tokyo Cabinet, Redis and so on).
  1. CppDB do not have the api for Cache Service(Memcache, Ehcache).**

### According the disadvantage and advantage of CppCMS ###
### CCppCMS's Base Principle like following: ###
**CCppCMS mainly has a few components.
  1. CppCMS
  1. CppDB stand alone C++ Connectivity library that supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite3 databases and generic ODBC drivers).**

**CCppCMS Customize.
  1. Custom Layouts, as Control,Module, Service, Dao and Dal.
  1. Custom Dal apis.**
